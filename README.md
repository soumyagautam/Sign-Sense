# Sign-Sense
Deep Learning and Neural Network based Sign Sense is an desktop app made for deaf/ dumb people. This will allow them to talk to anybody rather than just those who can understand their language.

Features:
  1. **Sign2Speech** can detect hand signs in a frame and can convert them to Speech, according to their respective meaning using mediapipe, keras, cv2, numpy, etc.
  2. Opposite to this, **Speech2Sign** can also recognise your voice and can convert it to sign language using speech recognition and OpenAI's Whisper API.
